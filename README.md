# bloc_implementation

A new Flutter project.


As developers we want to:

know what state our application is in at any point in time.
easily test every case to make sure our app is responding appropriately.
record every single user interaction in our application so that we can make data-driven decisions.
work as efficiently as possible and reuse components both within our application and across other applications.
have many developers seamlessly working within a single code base following the same patterns and conventions.
develop fast and reactive apps.
Bloc was designed to meet all of these needs and many more.

Bloc Concepts
